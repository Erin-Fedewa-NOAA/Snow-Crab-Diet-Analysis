#Preliminary Snow Crab DNA Metabarcoding Analyses 

Project PIs: Erin Fedewa, Louise Copeman, Wes Larson, Kim Ledger and Diana Baetscher

We used a primer set with broad taxonomic coverage (18S Universal metazoan primer) to amplify all potential prey groups from snow crab stomachs collected on the 2022 EBS and NBS bottom trawl surveys. In addition to amplifying prey, these primers also amplify contamination from non-food DNA, like parasites, fungi, and other microorganisms, as well as DNA from the snow crabs themselves. We also used fish-specific 125 MiFish primers to identify any fish prey items in the snow crab stomach.

DNA metabarcoding analyses were conducted at AFSC's Auke Bay Lab
